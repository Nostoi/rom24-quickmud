- Use `rg` for code searches; never run `grep -R`.
- Quote paths with spaces (e.g., `src/'QuickMUD Fixes'`).
- Update `doc/c_module_inventory.md` whenever C modules are added or removed.
- Always run `pytest` before committing.
- Maintain `doc/python_module_inventory.md` when Python modules change; keep C feature mapping current.
- Keep `doc/c_python_cross_reference.md` updated when subsystems move from C to Python.
- Maintain JSON schemas under `schemas/`; revise them whenever data formats change.
- Keep `schemas/character.schema.json` aligned with `char_data` structure; include new stats or flags immediately.
- Keep `schemas/object.schema.json` aligned with `OBJ_DATA`; update wear flags and value slots when they change.
- Keep `schemas/area.schema.json` aligned with `AREA_DATA`; capture vnum ranges and builder lists precisely.
- Validate every JSON schema with `jsonschema` tests; update tests when schemas change.
- Always convert `.are` files using `mud/scripts/convert_are_to_json.py`; never handcraft JSON.
- Clear registries before conversions to avoid leaking data between areas.
